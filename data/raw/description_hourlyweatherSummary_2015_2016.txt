timestamp
Date and time of the full hour.

apparentTemperature
The apparent (or “feels like”) temperature in degrees Celcius.

cloudCover

If defined, this property will have one of the following values: 
clear-day, clear-night, rain, snow, sleet, wind, fog, cloudy, partly-cloudy-day, or partly-cloudy-night. 

precipAccumulation
The amount of snowfall accumulation expected to occur, in inches. (If no snowfall is expected, this property will not be defined.)

precipIntensity
The intensity (in inches of liquid water per hour) of precipitation occurring at the given time.
This value is conditional on probability (that is, assuming any precipitation occurs at all) for minutely data points, and unconditional otherwise.

precipProbability
The probability of precipitation occurring, between 0 and 1, inclusive.

precipType
The type of precipitation occurring at the given time. If defined, this property will have one of the following values: 
"rain", "snow", or "sleet" (which refers to each of freezing rain, ice pellets, and “wintery mix”). 
(If precipIntensity is zero, then this property will not be defined. Additionally, due to the lack of data in our sources, historical precipType information is usually estimated, rather than observed.)

pressure
The sea-level air pressure in millibars.

summary
A human-readable text summary of this data point. 

temperature
The air temperature in degrees Celcius.

uvIndex
The UV index.

visibility
The average visibility in kilometers, capped at 10 kilometers.

windBearing
The direction that the wind is coming from in degrees, with true north at 0° and progressing clockwise. 
(If windSpeed is zero, then this value will not be defined.)

windSpeed
The wind speed in miles per hour.
