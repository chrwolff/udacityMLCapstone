# Udacity Machine Learning Capstone Project

## TL;DR
In this project, we will take a closer look at \myhref{Hubway}{https://www.thehubway.com}, Boston's regional bike sharing system. As of September 2017, it gives members access to more than 1,700 bikes at 170 stations.

All bike sharing programs share a common problem, which limits customer satisfaction: Rebalancing the bikes at the rental stations, so that the stations do not run empty or overflow.

This project follows the classical data science steps:
* Aquire data
* Cleanse data
* Explore/Visualize data
* Train a model
* Evaluate predictions
* Give end-user access to predictions
